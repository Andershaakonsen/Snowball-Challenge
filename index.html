          <h3>Our Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Our solution to stop world hunger is to prioritize peacekeeping forces. We want globally more contribution to the UN´s
            peacekeeping forces. We want every country in the world to commit to a more robust and equipped army. The UN´s forces
            should be able to solve conflicts without worrying about the recruiting and training of these soldiers and military
            personnel. Their sole focus should be to  solve conflicts peacefully and with the consent of all parties involved.

          <h3>Why it will work</h3>
          <p>
            War has often catastrophic consequences. It can destroy the progress of a country in a short period of time. People lose
            their jobs, their food sources, and it can erase a big portion of the country’s population. Peacekeeping forces has been
            shown to be a usefull tool to end conflicts around the world for many years now. If we can prevent conflicts from happening, and hopefully stop
            the current conflicts it would have a great impact on World Hunger.
